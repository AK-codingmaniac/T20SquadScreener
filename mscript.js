        bio: 'Arguably one of the finest ODI batsmen of all-time, and certainly the greatest of his generation, Virat Kohli has played three senior World Cups after leading the junior team to the title in 2008. In 2011, on his World Cup debut, Kohli played second fiddle to Virender Sehwag on his way to a fluent hundred against Bangladesh. After a great innings to start with, Kohli had a quiet World Cup before scoring an important 35 in the final to rescue the chase with Gambhir and lay the foundation for a second World Cup triumph. In the 2015 edition, Kohli was fully primed as India`s best limited-overs batsman with several solid performances under his belt and started off in fine fashion with a stable hundred against Pakistan. After a 46 against South Africa, his form took a dip during the latter stages of the World Cup before culminating in a 13-ball 1 as India crashed out of the World Cup in the semi-final. His ODI average in the 2017/18 ODI season has been a Bradmanesque 97.5, and he has amassed an unreal 19 hundreds since the 2015 World Cup. After the low of the World Cup ouster in 2016, Kohli leads the Indian side this time, with perhaps the strongest T20 team in the world, and as this generation`s greatest T20 batsman.',

        bio: 'Jadeja`s rise does have a lot to do with Dhoni`s undying support but it was actually the IPL that found the Saurashtra boy - or rather the legendary Shane Warne to be precise. As captain of the Rajasthan Royals, the Australian spotted Jadeja`s prowess and had said back in 2008-09 that this Rockstar would go places. He wasn`t wrong at all. After featuring for Rajasthan briefly, Jadeja became an integral part of the Chennai outfit till the squad was briefly suspended after the 2015 season. During the side`s two-year hiatus, its players were scattered across and Jadeja found himself with his native Gujarat franchise - a temporary side. With the Chennai squad returning from the 2018 season onwards, he was among the three people retained - proof enough of how much he is valued there.One of the main criticisms of Jadeja, the spinner, is that he often bowls darts than flighting the ball up and forcing a mistake from a batsman. Dhoni often chirping to him to bowl slower through the air is picked up by the stump mic and this means he is more of a defensive bowler than an attacking spinner who guarantees you wickets. This is precisely why we see him not employed to bowl by captains quite a few times on good batting surfaces. 2014 was the best year with the ball for him as he took 19 wickets to be second highest wicket-taker for the side.',
